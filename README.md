Online Registration Form

## Synopsis

RWD project for the Treehouse Frontend Web Developer TechDegree

From Treehouse: "In this project you'll build a responsive, mobile-friendly registration form using a wide variety of HTML form input types and attributes. Using the supplied mockup files you'll build a mobile and desktop version of the form using media queries, and a "mobile-first" approach."
